# Force Deployment

This file was created to force Vercel to deploy the latest commit (a0045a6) which includes the NavbarLogo component fix.

The previous deployment was using commit ba7bd87 which still had the TypeScript error.

This commit (a0045a6) fixes:
- NavbarLogo component now accepts children props
- TypeScript compilation error resolved
- Build should complete successfully

Deployment should now work without errors.
